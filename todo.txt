Todo:
=====

- Timer during editing
- include cohort information from Moodle on login
- implement proper "teacher" identification (perhaps from Moodle)
- Implement WebSockets and remove all $timeout() references that were used for polling
- Fix SLF4J's SimpleLogger to accept configuration parameters
- Write integration tests to test the full process of an assignment with multiple students


Student Bugs:
=============
- websocket reconnect no reliable
- while marking, there is no websocket (does there need to be?)
- check what happens when marking after assignment moved to grading
- student edits might be lost when automatically moving to marking


Teacher Bugs:
=============
